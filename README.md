#*The Adventures of Empress Cat Lady*

##Intro
*The Adventures of Empress Cat Lady* is a simple Frogger style game with some basic twists. Don't become too greedy chasing gems, or your character will become as slow as molasses.

##How To Run
The game can be run in your browser. Download the arcade-game file from github. Once on your machine, open 'index.html' with your favorite web browser to play the game locally. 

##How To Play
In game, you control Empress Cat Lady with your arrow keys. You can press the up, down, left, and right arrows to move the player a small distance. Or, for a long continuous movement, you can hold down a key. 

Beware that some elements in the game will affect your speed. Collectible hearts will increase your vitality, allowing your character to run faster. 

However, gems, which increase your score, weigh your player down and decrease the player's speed. Each time a bug collides with you, you will lose both a heart and a gem.

Every time your player reaches the top of the board, the enemy's speed will increase in relation to the level number. 

*Good luck*
